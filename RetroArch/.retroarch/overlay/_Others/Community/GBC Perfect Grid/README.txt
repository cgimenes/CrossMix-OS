Upscaled Perfect GBC Grid Overlays for Stock and Crossmix OS 

Thank you so much 1playerinsertcoin and mugwomp_93 for your work, this a upscaled version of the GBC Perfec Overlay for the RG35XX adapted for the Trimui Smart Pro, 
the rar includes 4 versions, two with bezels two without frames.

I will give you my screen settings, but I recommend to play with yours, because not all Trimuis have the same screens, some are cooler and some are 
warmer.

My screens settings are:

Brightness: 7
Contrast: 5
Saturation: 7
Color Temperature: 15
Exposure:  3

Put the Perfect overlay folder in the RetroArch\.retroarch\overlay folder
 
To apply the overlay and recommended settings:

1. Button Menu > Advanced Menu > Quick Menu > On-Screen Overlay

   Display Overlay > ON

   Overlay Preset...
     Navigate to the main Overlays folder: RetroArch\.retroarch\overlay
     - Perfect GBC Grid Folder
     - Select your preferred overlay


2. Quick Menu > Core Options:

    GB Colorization > GBC

    Color Correction > GBC Only

    Color Correction Mode > Accurate

    Color Correction - Frontlight Position > Above Screen (lighter, for more realistic GBC colors) or Central (darker, for more vibrant colors and inky blacks)

    Interframe Blending > Simple  (NOTE: If you don't like the image ghosting, turn it OFF, but you may see flickering elements in games.)

    Manage Core Options > Save Content Directory Options
