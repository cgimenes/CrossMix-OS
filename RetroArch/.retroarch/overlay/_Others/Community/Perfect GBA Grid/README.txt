Perfect GBA Grid Overlays for Stock and Crossmix OS 

Thank you so much 1playerinsertcoin for generating this 720p grid for the Trimui Smart Pro, the rar includes two versions with bezels and one with the grid
only. I will give you my screen settings, but I recommend to play with yours, because not all Trimuis have the same screens, some are cooler and some are 
warmer.

My screens settings are:

Brightness: 7
Contrast: 5
Saturation: 7
Color Temperature: 15
Exposure:  3

Put the Perfect overlay folder in the RetroArch\.retroarch\overlay folder
 
To apply the overlay and recommended settings:

1. Button Menu > Advanced Menu > Quick Menu > On-Screen Overlay

   Display Overlay > ON

   Overlay Preset...
     Navigate to the main Overlays folder: RetroArch\.retroarch\overlay
     - Perfect GBA Grid Folder
     - Select your preferred overlay


2. Quick Menu > Core Options:

    Video > Color Correction > OFF

    Video > Interframe Blending > Simple (NOTE: If you don't like the image ghosting, turn it OFF, but you may see flickering elements in games.)

    Manage Core Options > Save Content Directory Options


3a. Main Menu (press B to back out of Quick Menu) > Settings > Video

    Video Filter > Normal4X.filt



3b. Main Menu > Settings > Video > Scaling

    Integer Scale > OFF

    Aspect Ratio > Core Provided



3c. Quick Menu > Shaders

    Video Shaders > On

    Load Shaders > shaders_glsl\cubic\

    Select > bicubic.glslp

    Save Preset > Save Content Directory Preset



4. Once you've got everything configured the way you want it, save your settings:

   Quick Menu > Overrides > Save Content Directory Overrides


***Note that these are DARK overlays. You'll need to increase the screen brightness to get them to look right.
